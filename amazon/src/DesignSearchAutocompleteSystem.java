/**
 Design a search autocomplete system for a search engine. Users may input a sentence (at least one word and end with a special character '#').
 For each character they type except '#', you need to return the top 3 historical hot sentences that have prefix the same as the part of sentence already typed. Here are the specific rules:
 The hot degree for a sentence is defined as the number of times a user typed the exactly same sentence before.
 The returned top 3 hot sentences should be sorted by hot degree (The first is the hottest one).
 If several sentences have the same degree of hot, you need to use ASCII-code order (smaller one appears first).
 If less than 3 hot sentences exist, then just return as many as you can.
 When the input is a special character, it means the sentence ends, and in this case, you need to return an empty list.
